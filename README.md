**How do I approach designing software?**

I take an incremental approach to software design to make sure that each component is tested and integrates into the overall program. This strategy helps me stay aligned with user requirements while keeping development manageable and organized.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**

I acquired a variety of new skills such as transforming 3D shapes, constructing scenes, implementing camera movement, applying textures, and integrating lighting into 3D environments. These skills were important in building a realistic 3D scene.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

I used a modular design approach to ensure my code was functional, well-organized and easy to maintain. This helped improve the clarity of my implementation as well as debugging future additions. 

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

The modular approach is crucial for maintaing clean, reusable and scalable code. It enhances maintainablilty and reduces complexity, making development more efficient in future projects.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

I break down large objectives into smaller, more manageable tasks. This allows me to work incrementally, ensuring steady progress while maintaing focus on the functionality of each component. 

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

I strengthened my C++ programming skills and gained hands on experience with OpenGL. Additionally, I embraced a mindset of continuous learning because I allowed my self the time to experiment, learn from mistakes and improve the way I implement software. 

**How did iteration factor into your development?**

Iteration played a crucial role in creating my 3D scene. Through trial and error, I adjusted object placements, improved texture applications and optimized lighting effects. Each milestone served as a stepping stone towards the final project.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**

With each successful milestone, I gained confidence in my skills and because more creative in my problem-solving approach. This growth allowed me to experiment with new techniques and impoement features more efficently.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Since I want to work in game development, computer science provides me with important knowledge in programming, graphics and software engineering. The skills I'm building will be valuable for future internships and my professional growth.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

This class improved my efficiency, problem-solving and time management skills which will be useful to me through my Computer Science studies and future career in software development.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

This class directly helps me in my goal of becoming a game developer by providing foundational skills in 3D rendering and scene construction. The concepts I've learned such as transformations, texturing and lighting are building blocks for creating immersive game environments. These skills will help me succeed in future projects, internships and my professional career in game development.
